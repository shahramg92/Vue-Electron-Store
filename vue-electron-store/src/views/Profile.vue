    <p class="max-w leading-normal text-grey-lighter ml-10 mr-10">This app was created mainly for educational purposes. I wanted to use Vue.js and Electron together to create a desktop applicaiton which was something I had not done yet up until this point. I also wanted to implement a CSS framework called Tailwind CSS which excels in rapid UI development. All of the positioning of elements in this app was done using TailWind. My go-to for positioning elements is usually Flexbox so I wanted to try something new. I also made use of a third party package called Vue-Flickity which helped create the Carousel at the top of the Discover page. Overall, I am happy with this app and I feel it looks very similiar to the real app store. It is a little dynamic, but of course I could use an API instead of dummy data on the back end to pull data and populate the different areas of this app. I will probably not be doing that, simply because that would take very long and this app is just a demo app. Feel free to reach out to me at sha.ghassemi@gmail.com if you have any questions about this app or would like to know about my coding experience.</p>
